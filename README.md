Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project - Sparkify

### Key Deliverables: ###
- **Sparkify.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook with technical data manipulation and analysis.
- **Sparkify_Blog_Post.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook for the blog post.
- HTML view of blog post is [here](https://stannnman.github.io/Sparkify_Blog_Post.html)

### Libraries Used ###
- **pyspark** for data manipulation and machine learning
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data viz

### Motivation ###
Selected this project as a learning opportunity to skill up on PySpark, a technology for scalable data science that is widely used in industry today.

### Purpose: ###
This project seeks to use machine learning to predict customer churn for a hypothetical music streaming service called Spotify.

### Summary: ###
Successfully completed a full end-to-end data preparation, modelling and optimisation exercise using PySpark.
Gradient Boosted Trees emerged as the optimal model for predicting customer churn in this case.
